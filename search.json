    "title": "False conviction rates for death sentences",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Imagine standing in a courtroom. You are the innocent defendant in a trial, being prosecuted for a terrible crime. The jury comes out and gives their verdict - your body goes numb. Guilty. You’re given a death sentence for a crime you didn’t commit. It’s a mind-boggling situation. But it happens. We know it happens because we find people being exonerated from death sentences in light of new evidence, being released after half a lifetime in prison.\nThe hope is that this is a rare occurrence. But how often does it happen? \nSince 1973 there have been over 140 people exonerated from death row, with hundreds more exonerated from life sentences (note the differentiation between a death sentence and a life sentence). In 2007, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia asserted that the false conviction rate in American courts is around 0.027%. That’s about 1 in every 3,700. A rate this low would arguably be acceptable, as any working justice system must accept some level of error. But the rate given by the justice was calculated solely on the number of exonerated prisoners, which clearly does not alone tell the whole story. A recent study on the rate of false convictions noted that,\n\n“The vast majority of criminal convictions are not candidates for exoneration because no one makes any effort to reconsider the guilt of the defendants. Approximately 95% of felony convictions in the United States are based on negotiated pleas of guilty (plea bargains) that are entered in routine proceedings at which no evidence is presented. Few are ever subject to any review whatsoever. Most convicted defendants are never represented by an attorney after conviction, and the appeals that do take place are usually perfunctory and unrelated to guilt or innocence.”\n\nSo the actual rate must be higher than 0.027%, but by how much? This is what the study attempted to find out.\nFirst, to gain some perspective, let’s make a conservative guess and suppose that the rate is 0.1% (1 in every 1000). The U.S. prison population contains around 1.5 million people with 600,000 newly convicted each year. There are currently 2942 people [on death row](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row-inmates-state-and-size-death-row-year”, and a report by the Sentencing Project showed that about 10% of prisoners are serving life sentences. (This was a number that I found startling on its own.) A false conviction rate as modest as 0.1% translates to 3 innocent people on death row, and 150 serving life sentences with 60 more added each year.\nDepending on one’s point of view, those number may seem minuscule or quite large, but the situation turns out to be worse.\nThe study looked at the 7,482 defendants that were sentenced to death from 1973 to 2004 and used a statistical tool called the Kaplan-Meier curve to estimate the probability of being exonerated. Naturally, this probability increases the longer an inmate is on death row, because the more time you have to pursue legal recourse, the more likely you are to be exonerated. The question is, given enough time, what percent of inmates would be exonerated?\nThe study came to some disturbing conclusions. It found that if all death-row sentences remained on death row (that is, none are reduced to life-term sentences), an expected 4.1% would be exonerated (1 in 25). This rate translates to 116 people currently on death row who would be exonerated given enough time. If we extrapolate the 4% rate to the larger population of prisoners serving life sentences, it would translate to 6000 innocent people with 2400 added each year - but the paper correctly notes that the 4.1% rate does not necessarily hold for this group, and it is likely to be lower:\n\n“There are theoretical reasons to believe that the rate of false conviction may be higher for murders in general, and for capital murders in particular, than for other felony convictions, primarily because the authorities are more likely to pursue difficult cases with weak evidence of guilt if one or more people have been killed.”\n\nIt’s usually considered a triumph for the defense when a death sentence is reduced to a life sentence. But if 4% of those people are innocent, and being re-sentenced means their chances of being exonerated are crippled, then that triumph turns into a failure. In fact, the study draws the darkest conclusion for those, not on death row, but with life sentences:\n\n“Fewer than half of all defendants who are convicted of capital murder are ever sentenced to death in the first place. Sentencing juries, like other participants in the process, worry about the execution of innocent defendants. … It follows that the rate of innocence must be higher for convicted capital defendants who are not sentenced to death than for those who are. The net result is that the great majority of innocent defendants who are convicted of capital murder in the United States are neither executed nor exonerated. They are sentenced, or re-sentenced to prison for life, and then forgotten.”"

    "title": "Birthday Paradox and Forensic Science",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is derived from an interesting paper found in Law, Probability, and Risk. The birthday paradox, which comes up in probability theory, is used in the paper. The paradox goes something like this: Imagine you’re in a classroom with 30 students, and you are asked how likely it is that any two of those students will have the same birthday (same month and day). Intuitively, it seems fairly unlikely to find two such students. After all, it’s uncommon that you as an individual will run into someone with your same birthday. But as it turns out… \nIf you have a room of 30 students, about 70% of the time there will be two students with the same birthday. (The reasoning leading to this conclusion is presented in the paper, and there are many other more detailed explanations of the paradox.) This is a surprising result that highlights how unintuitive probability can be.\nNow what does this have to do with forensic science? Well, very little. But similar reasoning used to resolve the birthday paradox is used again later on (and the paper plays on this role to a much greater extent).\nOn the forensic science front, the big idea at play is the supposed law that patterns arising in nature are uniquely identifiable. For instance,the 3D pattern of a human fingerprint, or the impressions left on a bullet fired by a particular gun, are each unique. This fact is fine and is not what’s being challenged. In application, however, the complexity of the problem rises. Not only is each source unique, but each instance created by the source is also unique. For example, two fingerprints left by the same finger will not be entirely identical. (They won’t look exactly like each other, nor will they look exactly like the source.) The pressure applied by the finger, along with other variables, will have an influence on the print. And similarly, two bullets fired by the same gun will also have unique impressions left on them. From the paper:\n\n“Uniqueness does not guarantee that prints from two different people are always sufficiently different that they cannot be confused, or that two impressions made by the same finger will also be sufficiently similar to be discerned as coming from the same source.”\n\nThe proposition in forensic science, which the paper refers to as the law of nature, suggests that the unique instances will not lead to contradictory conclusions. That is, a full fingerprint found at a crime scene will not correspond to more than one source. (It will correspond to only one person.) This leads to the conclusion that if a fingerprint is “matched” to a particular person, it can be presented in a trial as a certainty. (There’s zero chance that it could match to any other person.) Part of the evidence for this proposition, the law of nature, lies heavily on the fact that contradictory conclusions have not yet been encountered.\nTake the following example: In a forensics case, a bullet is found at a crime scene. The investigators have 20 different guns that they test. The law of nature basically says that the imprint on the bullet will match to at most one gun (if any). So if a match is found with one of these twenty guns, we can say that the bullet was fired from that gun, and no other gun. Over the past few decades, there has yet to be a forensics case where a bullet has matched to more than one gun being investigated; this is part of the evidence in support for the law of nature.\nHere is where the birthday paradox comes into play. Basically, if the law of nature is true, then we will never find a case where a bullet would match to two guns; but even if the law of nature were false, it would still be very unlikely to find such a case. (This can be concluded through similar reasoning as the birthday paradox.) Thus the “evidence” in support of the law is not very substantial, because in either case we would find the same evidence.\nBut this is not all to say that the assumed law of nature is invalid. In fact it is most likely true (and even if it were false, the implications on its application would not change by much).\nWhat it does mean, however, is that the implied “certainty” presented in a trial should be replaced with a “most likely”. Forensics experts can testify that the bullet’s impressions correspond to that given by the defendant’s gun, but it could also correspond to that of another gun, one which we haven’t tested, although the probability of this happening extremely small. Commonly what happens is that the forensic evidence is given, but its inherit probability is not acknowledged. The key point is that a level of uncertainty does exist, and it should be presented accurately to the jury, so that they can weigh that piece of evidence appropriately."

In this article, we introduce a pseudo-value regression approach for network analysis (PRANA). This is a novel method of differential network analysis that also adjusts for additional clinical covariates. We start from mutual information criteria, followed by pseudo-value calculations, which are then entered into a robust regression model.\nResults This article assesses the model performances of PRANA in a multivariable setting, followed by a comparison to dnapath and DINGO in both univariable and multivariable settings through variety of simulations. Performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score of differentially connected (DC) genes is assessed. By and large, PRANA outperformed dnapath and DINGO, neither of which is equipped to adjust for available covariates such as patient-age. Lastly, we employ PRANA in a real data application from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify DC genes that are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to demonstrate its utility.\nConclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of utilizing a regression modeling for DN analysis by collective gene expression levels between two or more groups with the inclusion of additional clinical covariates. By and large, adjusting for available covariates improves accuracy of a DN analysis."

Accurate prognosis has remained a challenge for many patients. In this study, expression profiles from RNA-sequencing are used to predict survival times directly. Several models are investigated using various annotation levels of expression profiles (genes, transcripts, and introns), and an ensemble predictor is proposed as a heuristic for combining these different profiles.\nResults: The use of RNA-seq data is shown to improve accuracy in comparison to using clinical data alone for predicting overall survival times. Furthermore, clinically high-risk patients can be subclassified based on their predicted overall survival times. In this effort, the best performing model was the elastic net using both transcripts and introns together. This model separated patients into two groups with 2-year overall survival rates of 0.40±0.11 (n=22) versus 0.80±0.05 (n=68). The ensemble approach gave similar results, with groups 0.42±0.10 (n=25) versus 0.82±0.05 (n=65). This suggests that the ensemble is able to effectively combine the individual RNA-seq datasets. \nConclusions: Using predicted survival times based on RNA-seq data can provide improved prognosis by subclassifying clinically high-risk neuroblastoma patients."

As part of the 2017 CAMDA MetaSUB Inter-City Challenge, next generation sequencing (NGS) data was generated from swipe samples collected from subway stations in Boston, New York City hereafter New York, and Sacramento. DNA was extracted and Illumina sequenced. Sequencing data was provided for all cities as part of 2017 CAMDA contest challenge dataset.\nResults: Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear clustering of the samples for the three cities, with a substantial proportion of the variance explained by the first three components. We ran two different classifiers and results were robust for error rate (< 6%) and accuracy (> 95%). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that overall, bacterial composition across the three cities is significantly different. A similar conclusion was reached using a novel bootstrap based test using diversity indices. Last but not least, a co-abundance association network analyses for the taxonomic levels “order”, “family”, and “genus” found different patterns of bacterial networks for the three cities.\nConclusions: Bacterial fingerprint can be useful to predict sample provenance. In this work prediction of provenance reported with over 95% accuracy. Association based network analysis, emphasized similarities between the closest cities sharing common bacterial composition. ANOVA showed different patterns of bacterial amongst cities, and these findings strongly suggest that bacterial signature across multiple cities are different. This work advocates a data analysis pipeline which could be followed in order to get biological insight from this data. However, the biological conclusions from this analysis is just an early indication out of a pilot microbiome data provided to us through CAMDA 2017 challenge and will be subject to change as we get more complete data sets in the near future.

    "text": "Abstract\nMotivation: Gene expression data provide an opportunity for reverse-engineering gene-gene associations using network inference methods. However, it is difficult to assess the performance of these methods because the true underlying network is unknown in real data. Current benchmarks address this problem by subsampling a known regulatory network to conduct simulations. But the topology of regulatory networks can vary greatly across organisms or tissues, and reference-based generators—such as GeneNetWeaver—are not designed to capture this heterogeneity. This means, for example, benchmark results from the E. coli regulatory network will not carry over to other organisms or tissues. In contrast, probabilistic generators do not require a reference network, and they have the potential to capture a rich distribution of topologies. This makes probabilistic generators an ideal approach for obtaining a robust benchmarking of network inference methods.\nResults: We propose a novel probabilistic network generator that (1) provides an alternative to address the inherent limitation of reference-based generators and (2) is able to create realistic gene association networks, and (3) captures the heterogeneity found across gold-standard networks better than existing generators used in practice. Eight organism-specific and 12 human tissue-specific gold-standard association networks are considered. Several measures of global topology are used to determine the similarity of generated networks to the gold-standards. Along with demonstrating the variability of network structure across organisms and tissues, we show that the commonly used “scale-free” model is insufficient for replicating these structures."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe tumor microenvironment is composed of tumor cells, stroma cells, immune cells, blood vessels, and other associated non-cancerous cells. Gene expression measurements on tumor samples are an average over cells in the microenvironment. However, research questions often seek answers about tumor cells rather than the surrounding non-tumor tissue. Previousstudies have suggested that the tumor purity (TP)—the proportion of tumor cells in a solid tumor sample—has a confounding effect on differential expression (DE) analysis of high vs. low survival groups. We investigate three ways incorporating the TP information in the two statistical methods used for analyzing gene expression data, namely, differential network (DN) analysis and DE analysis. Analysis 1 ignores the TP information completely, Analysis 2 uses a truncated sample by removing the low TP samples, and Analysis 3 uses TP as a covariate in the underlying statistical models. We use three gene expression data sets related to three different cancers from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for our investigation. The networks from Analysis 2 have greater amount of differential connectivity in the two networks than that from Analysis 1 in all three cancer datasets. Similarly, Analysis 1 identified more differentially expressed genes than Analysis 2. Results of DN and DE analyses using Analysis 3 were mostly consistent with those of Analysis 1 across three cancers. However, Analysis 3 identified additional cancer-related genes in both DN and DE analyses. Our findings suggest that using TP as a covariate in a linear model is appropriate for DE analysis, but a more robust model is needed for DN analysis. However, because true DN or DE patterns are not known for the empirical datasets, simulated datasets can be used to study the statistical properties of these methods in future studies."

Exposing network irregularities offers an avenue for discovery in systems biology; these pursuits can include the study of gene function in developmental biology and understanding and treating diseases. Modern methods for differential network analysis often have two drawbacks: they implicitly rely on the selection of a relatively small subset of genes before analysis, and they are not flexible to the choice of association measure.\nMethods: A general framework for integrating known gene regulatory pathways into a differential network analysis is proposed. The framework allows for any gene-gene association measure to be used, and inference is carried out through permutation testing. A simulation study investigates the performance in identifying differentially connected genes when incorporating known pathways and compares the general framework to four state-of- the-art methods. Two RNA-seq datasets are analyzed to illustrate the use of this framework in practice.\nResults: The simulation study shows that incorporating pathway information can improve performance in terms of both sensitivity and true discovery rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art methods each estimate different things and are not directly comparable – this emphasizes the fact that the choice of association measure can have a strong influence on results. In the applied examples, the analysis reveals genes and pathways that are known to be biologically significant along with new findings to motivate future research.\nConclusions: The proposed framework makes explicit two critical, but often overlooked, assumptions: the selection of a subset of genes and the meaning of gene-gene association. The results obtained from analyzing gene expression with this framework are more interpretable, and the pathway information provides context that can lead to deeper insights."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe underlying driver of cancer stems from somatic mutations in the genome that change the function of gene products. However, not all mutations are associated with cancer progression. Rather, such “passenger” mutations are a symptom of DNA instability. Only a small portion of mutations are actual “drivers” that are responsible for disease progression. A methodology is proposed for analyzing gene expression data, to identify driver genes by considering both the functional changes of genes and the clinical relevance of those changes. Functional changes are identified by performing a differential network analysis, which compares the structure of gene-gene associations across different stages of cancer. Genes that are differentially connected indicate a change in their functional activity along with cancer progression. Clinical relevance of these differential connections is assessed using a survival model to predict overall survival. Potential driver genes are identified for Neuroblastoma and Breast cancer patient populations. We identify regulatory pathways that are both differentially connected and whose expression profile is predictive of overall survival. We plan to analyze additional cancers from the TCGA data repository and perform a meta-analysis to identify any pan-cancer driver genes or biomarkers.\nEvent: CMStatistics 2020"

    "text": "Abstract\nGene expression data from RNA-seq experiments provide a measure of biological activity at the cellular level. Differential expression (DE) analyses use these data to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated across groups of interest. Research in systems biology takes this analysis further by gleaning insights into gene regulatory networks through the analysis of gene co-expression networks. Similar to DE analysis, a differential network (DN) analysis is conducted to determine how co-expression patterns change across different groups of interest. A methodology is proposed for predictive modeling in this context that builds on a framework for conducting pathway-based differential network analysis. In an application to cancer gene expression datasets, our goal is to identify driver genes by considering both the functional changes of genes and the clinical relevance of those changes. Functional changes are identified by performing a differential network analysis, which compares the structure of gene-gene associations across different stages of cancer. Clinical relevance of these differential connections is assessed through predictive modeling.

Typical research questions included: How can gene expression be used to improve prediction of survival in cancer patients? Do gene regulatory networks differ in high-risk vs. low-risk patients, and what do those differences tell us about the underlying disease?\nI find that simulations are an indispensable tool for modern research. Aside from allowing us to assess model performance, creating a simulation forces us to think deeply about the data generating process and the context of the problem at hand–this is a process that has often lead me to new insights."

By my junior year I was strongly considering going to grad school for statistics–I was learning about ML and realized that, under the hood, it was all “just” math and statistics–but there was a catch. Most grad programs for statistics required advanced calc as a pre-req; I had one year to go, and there was exactly one advanced calc course offered the following Fall semester. If I wanted to apply to grad school, I’d have to take that course. But, of course, its scheduling conflicted with a required CS course that was also only offered in the Fall. If I wanted to graduate on time, I’d have to choose between finishing the CS degree or switching completely over to math with plans to apply to grad school… Let’s just say the year that followed was packed with a lot of math courses."
